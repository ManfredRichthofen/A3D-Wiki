<h2>Earl Miller SWX1 (Marlin 1.1.9)</h2><p>Earl Millers <a href="https://paypal.me/ancientwolfgr">Paypal</a></p><p><a href="https://3d-nexus.com/newsroom/news-announcements-m/artillery-sidewinder-x1-marlin-advanced-1-1-9-with-new-ui-and-mesh-bed-leveling-and-more">Website Page</a></p><p><a href="https://3d-nexus.com/resources/file-archives/download/5-printer-firmware/11-artillery-swx1-marlin-1-1-9-advanced-firmware-and-gui">Download</a></p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>Save to EEPROM</strong><br>Enabled EEPROM to persist settings. Now you can store PIDs and Z offsets to EEPROM.</p><p><strong>P.I.D. Auto-tune - Extruder AND Bed In One Operation</strong><br>PID Tuning improves your hotend/bed temperature stability and will positively impact print quality. This command initiates a process of heating and cooling to determine the proper PID values for your hotend. This may take up to 10 minutes. During the tuning process the LED will stay&nbsp;<strong>Red</strong>. Once the process is finished, the LED will turn&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong>. <strong>Make sure you wait!</strong> Your machine specific PID values are now in use. <strong>However, if you want to persist your PID settings you must execute “Store to EEPROM</strong>”.</p><p><strong>Mesh Bed Leveling</strong><br>Mesh Bed Leveling (MBL) allows interactively measuring a Z height mesh without a bed probe (like BLTouch or similar). The only tool required is a piece of paper or a feeler gauge. MBL uses the mesh to compensate for variations in height across the bed. You simply begin the probing and hit save at point 9. <strong>I will include a tutorial and perhaps a video demonstrating this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some important notes below in the tutorial section. Make sure you read them.</strong></p><p><strong>Linear Advance</strong><br>Linear Advance is now activated, but the set the K_Factor to 0, so it is disabled. To enable it using gcode you should first calibrate your specific K factor. You can do this <a href="https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html">here</a>. Accordingly set the K factor within your slicer or command interface using e.g. M900 K0.2 (as an example)</p><p><strong>Preheat Preset for PLA</strong></p><p>Its with the PID Auto-tune and MBL section to keep things tidy- it lets you easily preheat to given preset, you can change the temps in the mks_config.txt.</p><p><strong>Live Adjust Z / Baby-stepping Z</strong><br>During printing the first layer you can still adjust the distance between the nozzle and the print-bed. E.g. if you find your print is not sticking you can carefully step down the nozzle or correct it up again without the need to re-level all four screws at the same time. However, this assumes the bed is in level overall but maybe just a little too low or too high overall. You need to execute Store To EEPROM to persist Z Values. (There is a Save to EEPROM in the interface for this)</p><h2>Pinguinpfleger SWX1 (Marlin 2.X.X)</h2><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><p><strong>P.I.D. Auto-Tune</strong></p><p>PID Tuning improves your hotend/bed temperature stability and will positively impact print quality. This command initiates a process of heating and cooling to determine the proper PID values for your hotend. This may take up to 5 minutes. During the tuning process the LED will stay <strong>Red</strong>. Once the process is finished, the LED will turn <strong>Green</strong>. Make sure you wait! Your machine specific PID values are now in use. However, if you want to persist your PID settings you must execute “Store to EEPROM”</p><p><strong>Save to EEPROM</strong><br>Enabled EEPROM M500 to persist settings.<br>Now you can store PIDs and Z-Offsets to EEPROM</p><p><strong>LINEAR ADVANCE activated</strong><br>Linear Advance brings you better dimensional precision due to reduced bleeding edges.<br>Higher printing speeds are possible without any loss of print quality - as long as your extruder can handle the needed speed changes.<br>Visible and tangible print quality is increased even at lower printing speeds.<br>No need for high acceleration and jerk values to get sharp edges.<br>Read <a href="https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html">https://marlinfw.org/docs/features/lin_advance.html</a> for more details and how to calibrate.<br>By default the K_Factor is set to 0, so it is disabled.<br>To enable it using gcode you should first calibrate your specific K factor.<br>You can do this <a href="https://marlinfw.org/tools/lin_advance/k-factor.html">here</a>. Accordingly set the K factor within your slicer using e.g. M900 K0.2</p><p><strong>S_CURVE ACCELERATION activated</strong><br>This option eliminates vibration during printing by fitting a Bézier curve to move acceleration, producing much smoother direction changes.</p><p><strong>ADAPTIVE STEP SMOOTHING activated</strong><br>Adaptive Step Smoothing increases the resolution of multi-axis moves, particularly at step frequencies below 1kHz (for AVR) or 10kHz (for ARM), where aliasing between axes in multi-axis moves causes audible vibration and surface artifacts. The algorithm adapts to provide the best possible step smoothing at the lowest stepping frequencies.</p><p><strong>Live Adjust Z / Baby-stepping Z</strong></p><p>During printing the first layer you can still adjust the distance between the nozzle and the print-bed. E.g. if you find your print is not sticking you can carefully step down the nozzle or correct it up again without the need to re-level all four screws at the same time. However, this assumes the bed is in level overall but maybe just a little too low or too high overall. You need to execute StoreToEEPROM to persist Z Values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
