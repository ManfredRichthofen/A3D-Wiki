Now you can store PIDs and Z offsets to EEPROM.</p><p><strong>P.I.D. Autotune - Extruder AND Bed In One Operation</strong><br>PID Tuning improves your hotend/bed temperature stability and will positively impact print quality. This command initiates a process of heating and cooling to determine the proper PID values for your hotend. This may take up to 10 minutes. During the tuning process the LED will stay&nbsp;<strong>Red</strong>. Once the process is finished, the LED will turn&nbsp;<strong>Green</strong>. <strong>Make sure you wait!</strong> Your machine specific PID values are now in use. <strong>However, if you want to persist your PID settings you must execute “Store to EEPROM</strong>”.</p><p><strong>Mesh Bed Leveling</strong><br>Mesh Bed Leveling (MBL) allows interactively measuring a Z height mesh without a bed probe (like BLTouch or similar). The only tool required is a piece of paper or a feeler gauge. MBL uses the mesh to compensate for variations in height across the bed. You simply begin the probing and hit save at point 9. <strong>I will include a tutorial and perhaps a video demonstrating this process.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some important notes below in the tutorial section. Make sure you read them.</strong></p><p><strong>Linear Advance</strong><br>Linear Advance is now activated, but the set the K_Factor to 0, so it is disabled. To enable it using gcode you should first calibrate your specific K factor. Accordingly set the K factor within your slicer or command interface using e.g. M900 K0.2 (as an example)</p><p><strong>Preheat Preset for PLA</strong></p><p>Its with the PID Autotune and MBL section to keep things tidy- it lets you easily preheat to given preset, you can change the temps in the mks_config.txt.</p><p><strong>Live Adjust Z / Babystepping Z</strong><br>During printing the first layer you can still adjust the distance between the nozzle and the print-bed. E.g. if you find your print is not sticking you can carefully step down the nozzle or correct it up again without the need to re-level all four screws at the same time. However, this assumes the bed is in level overall but maybe just a little too low or too high overall. You need to execute Store To EEPROM to persist Z Values. (There is a Save to EEPROM in the interface for this)</p>
